Linux Tarvalds:

Git:
  --> Version control system
  -->Multiple people can share the files
  ---> tracking the changes in files like who has done th changes
 
 3 types of VCS:
 -----------------
 1.Local version control system
 2.centralised VCS: create a sever and share the data via that server
                  But if sever is lost or down we will loose the data
3.Distributed VCS: Every one can work parallely on that files
